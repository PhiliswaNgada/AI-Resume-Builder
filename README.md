## Running React on Replit

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)

### State Management
- **Local State**: Using React hooks for component-level state
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage for maintaining user data across sessions
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate preview updates as users type

- **Efficient Re-renders**: Optimized state updates to minimize unnecessary re-renders

## API Integration Methodology

The system is designed to work entirely client-side with mock AI suggestions. For production deployment:

1. **AI Integration**: Replace mock suggestions with real AI API calls (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.)
2. **ATS Analysis**: Integrate with professional ATS analysis services
3. **Job Matching**: Connect to job board APIs for real-time job matching
